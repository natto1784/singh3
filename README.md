# Singh3
My stupid discord bot that I will probably stop maintaining again like I did for the past 8+ months
Real shit code
- Not really a useful bot, run at your own risk
- You need postgresql too
- Environment Variables
    - DISCORD_TOKEN={{.your-discord-token}}
    - DB_URL={{.your-postgresql-db-url}}
- Image size is kinda large cuz it uses ubuntu for libraries that are dynamically needed
